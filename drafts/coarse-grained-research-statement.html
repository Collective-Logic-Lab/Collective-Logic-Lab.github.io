		<h2>Level 3 (full jargon)</h2>
<p>Research identity statement
(last revised in 2022)</p>
<p>We are inspired by impressive feats of coordination that are so common in the biological world that it is easy to forget how unlikely they are.  Cells differentiate into distinct types, carrying out well-specified roles based on noisy expression and interaction of gene products.  Brains actuate reproducible, adaptive responses using a noisy, ever-changing jumble of electrical activity.  A honeybee colony can quickly change its behavior in response to a shock, distributing tasks efficiently among individuals without centralized control.</p>
<p>These are all examples of collectives, cases in which we understand in some detail how interactions play out at the level of individual components, but the relevant outputs are at the level of the aggregate.  The mapping from micro to macro level behavior is typically intricate and often mysterious.</p>
<p>Multiple academic disciplines have developed tools to approach specific aspects of collective behavior.  Statistical physics has a long history of explaining collective dynamics of large systems, but for much simpler components like atoms and molecules.  Machine learning looks for aggregated patterns in data, but typically lacks understanding of how these patterns are connected to the behavior of individual components.  Biology has a wealth of knowledge about how component mechanisms contribute to collective function, but is confronting conceptual difficulties in scaling up to systems that have a large number of strongly interacting components.  Our group combines and builds from these existing tools, focusing not within a discipline but on our driving question: What is the logic of collective behavior?</p>
<p>We look particularly for formalisms that can apply across multiple examples of living systems.  These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>branching process descriptions of the amplification implicit in activity propagation</li>
<li>fundamental trade-offs between design goals, such as robustness versus sensitivity and speed versus accuracy</li>
<li>descriptions in terms of collective instabilities, relating to concepts of bifurcations and phase transitions</li>
<li>the identification and definition of collective variables that are optimal in efficiently describing complex collective behavior</li>
<li>notions of control that constrain the mechanisms through which collectives are able to adaptively respond to changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Dimensionality reduction is key to this endeavor, leading to simplified, aggregate-level approximations of high-dimensional systems.  In our view, inspired both by <a href="/pdfs/Del_rigor_en_la_ciencia.pdf">Borges</a> and the concept of coarse-graining in statistical physics, such simplification is not merely convenient but integral to what it means to do science.  In this spirit, the coarse-grained, simplified explanations we give in the alternate versions of this research statement are equally valuable as this detailed, jargon-heavy version.</p>
<p>We interface with questions in evolutionary theory about how collectives came to be organized the way they are.</p>
<p>We are question-oriented</p>
<p>Collective behavior is a major scientific question of our times.</p>
<h2>Level 2 (everyday language)</h2>
<p>Collectives are all around us.  These are groups like fish in a school, or bees in a hive, or neurons in a brain.  In all these cases, the group does something together — spot a predator, or survive the winter, or make decisions — that is harder for individuals to do themselves.  But understanding how the group's behavior is controlled by the individuals that make it up, and predicting how the group might change to work better, is notoriously tricky.  In fact, it has been said that this problem is at the heart of the world's outstanding scientific mysteries.</p>
<p>In our research, we look for patterns in how living systems achieve desired collective behavior.  These patterns range from basic to complicated.  As a simpler example, the mathematics of how activity spreads across a group can reveal how disease spreading across the world is similar to conflict spreading through a society or information spreading through a brain.  At the complex end of the spectrum, many living systems seem to be just near the edge of spiraling out of control, seemingly managing a trade-off between maintaining a stable status quo and being reactive to changes that can be quickly amplified.</p>
<p>Why do we care about these patterns?  As scientists, we are driven mainly by curiosity.  But there are bigger issues at stake, too.  We live in the first era in which our collective behavior is felt not just at the scale of our community or country, but at the global scale.  We are facing problems that are analogous to a colony of bees: If the colony gets too hot, before the wax melts, individual bees move to the entrance and start fanning their wings.  How do they efficiently move from the status quo (say, foraging for food) to make a collective decision to fan the nest?  If we can understand the patterns that we see played out so successfully in other living systems, maybe we can use them ourselves to ensure our collective survival.</p>
<p>drives us to explore the unexplained</p>
<h2>Level 1 (distilled to its essence)</h2>
<p><em>Idea from <a href="http://xkcd.com/1133">xkcd</a> with help from <a href="https://www.splasho.com/upgoer5">up-goer five text editor</a></em></p>
<p>Groups do great things together.  This is true for groups of people, but also many other kinds of groups.  I am talking about groups of cells in your brain that talk to each other when you think.  I am talking about groups of tiny pieces dancing around inside your cells that break down your food and control how your body works.  I am talking about animals that live together and share the work of building their home and finding food.</p>
<p>Often the way these groups work is hard to understand.  Can we figure out which parts of the group control what the group does as a whole?  We study these groups and try to find out how they work.  We get excited when different groups seem to work in the same way.  Sometimes we can find ways that very different groups actually work in the same way, once you figure out the right way to look at it.</p>
<p>People have studied for a long time how groups of very simple things work, like the huge number of little bits that make up stuff like rocks.  They have ways of thinking about groups that help us understand things like why some rocks are harder than others, or why you can use some rocks to make phones and computers and so on.  It all has to do with how the bits of the rock work together.  Some of these same ideas can help us think about very different sorts of groups, like bodies and animals and brains.  Maybe these ideas could also one day help groups of people live better together.</p>
